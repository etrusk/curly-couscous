# Prompting Guidelines

## Before Starting Work
If the request is vague, ask for:
- Specific file paths involved
- Function/method signatures expected
- Framework or library versions
- Patterns from existing code to follow
- Constraints (performance, compatibility, style)

## Don't Guess
If critical details are missing, ask — don't assume.
One clarifying question beats a wrong implementation.
